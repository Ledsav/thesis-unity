# MSc Thesis: Affective Computing in Virtual Reality Environment

## Overview

This repository contains the code and assets for my MSc thesis project on affective computing within virtual reality (VR) environments. The project explores how emotional responses can be measured and analyzed in VR using skin conductance signals and other biomedical signals.

## Publication

The work conducted in this thesis led to the publication of a research paper titled:

**Exploring Emotional Responses in Virtual Reality Through Skin Conductance Signal**

## Abstract

In this study, we investigated the emotional responses of users in virtual reality environments through the measurement of skin conductance signals. Our findings demonstrate the potential of affective computing to enhance the immersive experience of VR by adapting the environment based on the user's emotional state.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2019.4 or later
- VR Headset (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. Set up your VR headset

### Usage
1. Import the necessary packages and assets into your Unity project.
2. Attach the skin conductance sensor to the user's fingers.
3. Run the VR start scene in Unity.
